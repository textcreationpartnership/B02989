            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179843:3"/>their Liberties, and the Peace of the Kingdome; and that we would addreſſe our ſelves to your Majeſtie in their behalf, that by our means their deſires may find better acceptation with your Majeſtie. Whereupon, having ſeriouſly weighed and conſidered the particulars of thoſe their complaints and deſires, as they are laid down in their Petition, and finding that the Grievances they complain of, are the increaſe of the miſeries formerly ſuſtained by that County (which hath well-nigh, for three years laſt paſt, been the tragicall Stage of Armies and Warre) by reaſon of your Majeſties diſtance in Reſidence, and difference in Councels from your great Councel, the Parliament, begetting great diſtempers and diſtractions throughout the Kingdome, and eſpecially in that Countie; The drawing to thoſe parts great numbers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons, that may too juſtly be feared, do affect the publick ruine for their private advantage; The drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of many Companies of the Trained Bands, and others both Horſe and Foot of that Countie, and retaining multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Commanders and Cavaliers from other parts; The daily reſort of Recuſants to your Majeſties Court at <hi>York;</hi> The great preparations of Arms, and other warlike Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the great terrour and amazement of your Majeſties peaceable Subjects, and cauſing a great decay of Trade and Commerce amongſt them; All and every of which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are againſt the Law, which your Majeſtie hath made ſo many, and ſo frequent profeſſions to uphold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And the Lords and Commons finding, on the other ſide, their humble deſires to be, That your Majeſtie would hearken to your Parliament, and declining all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels whatſoever, unite your Confidence to your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And that your Majeſtie would not divide your Subjects joynt-duty to your Majeſty, the Parliament and

            <head>¶ His MAjESTIES Anſwer to the aforeſaid Petition.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Majeſtie having carefully weighed the matter of this Petition, preſented to Him at <hi>York,</hi> on Friday the ſeventeenth of June, by the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmcley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> though he might referre the Petitioners to his two laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, wherein moſt of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this Petition are fully anſwered, or might refuſe to give any Anſwer at all, till He had received ſatisfaction in thoſe high Indignities He hath ſo often complained of, and demanded Juſtice for: Yet that all the world may ſee how deſirous His Majeſtie is to leave no Act, which ſeems to carry the Reputation of both His Houſes of Parliament, and in the leaſt degree to reflect upon His Majeſties Juſtice and Honour unanſwered, He is graciouſly pleaſed to return this Anſwer:</p>
            <p>THat if the Petition mentioned to be preſented to both Houſes of Parliament, had been annexed to this now delivered to Him, His Majeſtie might have diſcerned the number and the qualitie of the Petitioners, which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie hath great reaſon to believe, was not in truth ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as is pretended; for his Majeſtie aſſures you, That He hath never refuſed any Petition ſo atteſted as that would be thought to be. But His Majeſtie well remembers, That on the third of June, when there was, upon His Majeſties Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the greateſt and the moſt chearfull concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ever was beheld of one County, appearing before Him at <hi>York,</hi> a Gentleman (one Sir <hi>Thomas Fayrefax</hi>) offered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179843:5"/>in that great Confluence, a Petition to His Majeſtie, which His Majeſtie ſeeing to be avowed by no man but himſelf, and the generall and univerſall Acclamations of the people ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſclaim it, did not receive, conceiving it not to be of ſo publick a nature as to be fit to be preſented or received in that place: And His Majeſtie is moſt conſident (and in that muſt appeal to thoſe who were then preſent) that what ever the ſubſtance of that Petition was, it was not conſented to by any conſiderable number of Gentry or Freeholders of this Countie; but ſolicited by a few, mean, inconſiderable perſons, and diſliked and viſibly diſcountenanced by the great body of the known Gentrie, Clergie, and Inhabitants of this whole County. And if the matter of that Petition were ſuch as is ſuggeſted in this, His Majeſtie hath great reaſon to believe it was framed and contrived (as many others of ſuch nature have been) in <hi>London,</hi> not in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> For ſure no Gentleman of quality and underſtanding, of this Countie, would talk of his great preparations of Arms, and other warlike Proviſions, to the great terrour and amazement of His peaceable Subjects, when they are witneſſes of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent taking His Arms from Him, and ſtopping all wayes for bringing more to Him; And if there were no greater terrour and amazement of His Majeſties peaceable Subjects in other places by ſuch preparations and proviſions, there would be no more cauſe to complain of a great decay of Trade and Commerce there, then is in this place: But His Majeſtie hath ſo great an aſſurance of the fidelity and generall affections of His good Subjects of this County (which He hopes will prove exemplar over His whole Kingdome) that He hath great cauſe to believe, That they do rather complain of His Majeſties confidence, and of His ſlowneſſe, that whilſt there is ſuch endeavour abroad to raiſe Horſe, and to provide Arms againſt His Majeſtie, and that endeavour put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179843:5"/>His Majeſtie truſts ſo much to the Juſtice of His cauſe, and the affections of his people, and neglects to provide ſtrength to aſſiſt that Juſtice, and to protect thoſe affections. For any affronts offered by the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> and the Lord <hi>Savile,</hi> to thoſe who intended to petition His Majeſtie, His Majeſtie wiſhes that both His Houſes of Parliament would have examined that Information, and the credit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, with that gravity and deliberation, as in caſes which concern the Innocence and Honour of perſons of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath been accuſtomed, before they had proſcribed two Peers of the Realm, and expoſed them (as much as in them lay) to the rage and fury of the people, under the Character of being Enemies to the Commonwealth, a brand newly found out (and of no legall ſignification) to incenſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by, and with which the ſimplicity of former times was not acquainted: And then His Majeſtie hath ſome reaſon to believe they would have found themſelves as much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the report concerning thoſe Lords, as he is ſure they are in thoſe which tell them of the reſort of great numbers of diſcontented perſons to Him, and of the other particulars, mentioned to be in that Petition: Whereas they who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what reſort is here to His Majeſtie, well know it to be of the prime Gentlemen of all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> whom nothing but the love of Religion, the care of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdome, beſides their affection to His Perſon, could engage into great journeys, trouble, and expence, men of as precious reputation, and as exemplary lives as this Nation hath any; whole aſſiſtance His Majeſtie knows He muſt not exped, if He ſhould have the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne againſt Honour and Juſtice; and ſuch witneſſes His Majeſtje deſires to have of all His actions.</p>
            <p>For the declining all other Councels, and the uniting His Confidence to His Parliament, His Majeſty deſires both His
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179843:6"/>Houſes of Parliament ſeriouſly and ſadly to conſider, That it is not the name of a great or little Councel that makes the Reſults of that Councel Juſt or Unjuſt, Neither can the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon His Majeſty, of not being adviſed by His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (eſpecially ſince all their Actions, and all their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are expoſed to the publick view) long miſ-lead His good Subjects, except in truth they ſee ſome particular found Advice, neceſſary to the Peace and Happineſſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, diſ-eſteemed by His Majeſty; and ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance He is moſt aſſured, neither can, nor ſhall be given: And that they will think it merit in His Majeſty, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to reject ſuch Counſel as would perſwade Him to make Himſelf none of the Three Eſtates, by giving up His negative voice, to allow them a Power ſuperiour to that which the Law hath given Him, whenſoever it pleaſeth the Major part, preſent, of both Houſes, to ſay, That He doth not diſcharge His Truſt, as He ought, and to ſubject His, and His Subjects unqueſtionable Right and Proprietie to their Votes, without, and againſt Law, upon the meer pretence of neceſſity. And His Majeſty muſt appeal to all the world, who it is that endeavours to divide the joynt-duty of His Subjects; His Majeſty, who requires nothing but what their own duty, guided by the infallible Rule of the Law, leads them to do; or they, who by Orders and Votes (oppoſite and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to Law, Cuſtome, Preſident, and Reaſon) ſo confound the Affections and Vnderſtandings of His good Subjects, that they know not how to behave themſelves with Honeſty and Safety, whileſt their Conſcience will not ſuffer them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the one, nor their Security to apply themſelves to the other.</p>
            <p>It is not the bare ſaying, That His Majeſties Actions are againſt the Law (with which he is reproched in this Petition, as if He departed from His often Proteſtations to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179843:6"/>muſt conclude Him, there being no one ſuch particular in that Petition alledged, of which His Majeſty is in the leaſt degree guilty: Whether the ſame reverence and eſteem be paid by you to the Law, (except your own Votes be judge) needs no other evidence then thoſe many, very many Orders publiſhed in print, both concerning the Church and State, thoſe long impriſonments of ſeverall perſons, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, upon generall information, and the great unlimited Fees to your Officers, worſe then the impriſonment, and the Arbitrary Cenſure upon them when they are admitted to be heard; let the Law be judge by whom it is violated.</p>
            <p>For that part of the Petition which ſeems to accuſe His Majeſty of a purpoſe to diſſolve this Parliament (contrary to the Act for the Continuance) by commanding away the Lords and great Officers, whole attendance is neceſſary, which His Majeſty well knows to be a new Calumnie, by which the grand Contrivers of ruine for the State, hope to ſeduce the minds of the People from their Affection to, or into Jealouſie of his Majeſty, as if He meant this way to bring this Parliament (which may be the caſe of all Parliaments) to nothing: It is not poſſible for His Majeſty more to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his Affection to, and his Reſolution for the Freedome, Liberty, and frequency of Parliaments, then He hath done: And who ever conſiders how viſible it muſt be to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, That it is impoſſible for Him to ſubſiſt, without the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of His people, and that thoſe Affections cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be preſerved, or made uſe of, but by Parliaments, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give the leaſt credit, or have the leaſt ſuſpicion, that his Majeſty would chuſe any other way to the happineſſe He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for Himſelf and His Poſterity, but by Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But for His calling the Lords hither, or any others abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, who have not been called; whoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Tumults (which no Votes or Declaration can make
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179843:7"/>to be no Tumults) by which His Majeſtie was driven away, and many Members of either Houſe in danger of their lives; The demanding the names of thoſe Lords who would not conſent to their Propoſitions by Meſſage from the Houſe of Commons, delivered at the Barre by Matter <hi>Hollis,</hi> with that moſt tumultuous Petition in the name of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands (among many other of the ſame kinde) directed to the Houſe of Commons, and ſent up by them to the Houſe of Lords, taking notice of the prevalencie of a Malignant faction which made abortive all their good Motions, which tended to the Peace and Tranquilitie of the Kingdome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, That thoſe noble Worthies of the Houſe of Peers, who concurred with them in their happy Votes, might be earneſtly deſired to joyn with that honourable Houſe, and to ſit and Vote as one entire Body; profeſſing. That unleſſe ſome ſpeedie remedie were taken for the removall of all ſuch Obstructions as hindred the happy progreſſe of their great endeavours, their Petitioners ſhould not reſt in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but ſhould be inforced to lay hold on the next remedy which was at hand to remove the diſturbers of their Peace, and (want and neceſſitie breaking the bounds of modeſtie) not to leave any means unaſſayed for their relief; Adding, that the cry of the poore and needy was, That ſuch perſons who were the Obſtacles of their peace, and hinderers of the happy proceedings of this Parliament, might be forthwith publickly declared, whoſe removall, they conceived, would put a period to theſe diſtractions, Upon which, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lords departing, the Vote, in order to the Ordinance concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> was immediately paſſed, though it had been twice before put to the queſtion and rejected by the Votes of much the major part of that Houſe. And who ever conſiders the ſtrange Orders, Votes and Declarations which have ſince paſſed, to which whoſoever would not conſent,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179843:7"/>that is, with freedome and libertie of Language profeſſe againſt, was in danger of cenſure and impriſonment, will not blame Our care in ſending for them, or theirs in coming, or abſenting themſelves from being involved in ſuch Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Neither will it be any objection that they ſtayed there long after any tumults were, and therefore that the tumults drave them not away. If every day produced Orders and Reſolutions as illegall as, and indeed, but the effects of the tumults, there was no cauſe to doubt the ſame power would be ready to prevent any oppoſition to thoſe Orders after they were made, which had made way and preparation for the propoſition of them, and ſo whoſoever conceived himſelf in danger of future tumults (againſt which there is not the leaſt proviſion) was driven away by thoſe which were paſt. And his Majeſtie hath more reaſon to wonder at thoſe who ſtay behind, after all His legall Power is voted from him, and all the people told, That He might be with modeſty and duty enough depoſed, then any man hath at thoſe who have been willing to withdraw themſelves from the place where ſuch deſperate and dangerous Poſitions are avowed. Which his Majeſtie doth not mention, with the leaſt thought of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the power or validity of any Act to which He hath given his Aſſent this Parliament, al &amp; every of which He ſhall as inviolably obſerve, as He looks to have his own rights pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but to ſhew by what means ſo many ſtrange Orders have of late been made; &amp; to ſhew how earneſtly his Majeſtie deſires to be preſent at, and receive advice from both Houſes of Parliament, (againſt whom it ſhall never be in the power of a Malignant party to incenſe his Majeſtie) his Majeſtie again offers his Conſent, That both Houſes may be adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another place which may be thought convenient, where his Majeſtie will be preſent, and doubts not but the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of either Houſe will make a full Appearance, and even
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179843:8"/>the intermiſſion which muſt attend ſuch an adjournment, may not be the leaſt means of recovering that temper which is neceſſary for ſuch debates.</p>
            <p>And this His Majeſtie conceives to be ſo very neceſſary, that if the Minds and Inclinations of every Member of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe were equally compoſed, the Licence is ſo great, that the mean People about <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs have taken, that both for the Libertie and Dignitie of Parliament, that Convention for a time ſhould be in another place. And ſure, how much ſoever the ſafety and ſecurity of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome depends on Parliaments, it will never be thought, that thoſe Parliaments muſt of neceſſitie be at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſties Confidence is no leſſe then He hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, (and hath great Cauſe to expreſſe) in the Affections of this County, an inſtance of which Affections all men know, His Guard (which is not extraordinary) to be, and wonders that ſuch a Legall Guard, at His own charge, for His Perſon, (within twenty Miles of a Rebellion, and of an Armie in Pay againſt Him) ſhould be objected by thoſe, who for ſo many Moneths, and in a Place of known, and confeſſed Securitie, have without and againſt Law, kept a guard for themſelves, at the Charge of the Common-wealth, and upon that ſtock of money which was given for the Relief of the miſerable &amp; bleeding Condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great debt due to Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Reſort of Papiſts to the Court, his Majeſties great Care for the prevention thereof, is notoriouſly known; That when he was informed two or three of His intended Guard were of that Religion, He gave ſpeciall direction, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of His diſpleaſure, That they ſhould be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged, and provided that no Perſon ſhould attend on Him under that Relation, but ſuch as took the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Supremacy; That He commanded the Sheriffe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179843:8"/>to proceed with all ſeverity, according to the Law, againſt all Papiſts that ſhould come within five Miles of the Court; and if, notwithſtanding this, there be any Papiſts near the Court, (which his Majeſty aſſures you He knows not, nor hath heard, but by this Petition) He doth hereby command them to depart; and declares to all Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, that they ſhall proceed ſtrictly againſt them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, and as they will anſwer the contrary at their perils.</p>
            <p>For the language and behaviour of the Cavaliers (a word, by what miſtake ſoever it ſeems, much in disfavour) there hath not been the leaſt Complaint here; and therefore 'tis probable the fault was not found in this County. Neither can his Majeſty imagine what is meant by the mention of any men thruſt upon them, in ſuch Conſultations and Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as his Majeſty makes to this County, who are neither by their Fortune or Reſidence any part of it, and therefore can make no Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, his Majeſty aſſures you, He hath never refuſed to receive any Petition, (whether you have or no, your ſelves beſt know) and wills you to conſider what reputation it will be to you of Juſtice or Ingenuity to receive all Petitions, how ſenſeleſſe and ſcandalous ſoever, of one kind, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of underſtanding the good peoples minds and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not onely refuſe the Petition, but puniſh the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of another kind, under colour, That it is a Crime, That they are not ſatisfied with your ſenſe; as if you were onely truſted by the people of one opinion, to take all pains to publiſh and print Petitions which agree with your wiſhes, though they were never preſented, and to uſe the ſame Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Authority to keep thoſe that indeed were preſented and avowed, from being publiſhed (though by Our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) becauſe the Argument is not pleaſant to you; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179843:9"/>impartiality a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> infallibility, and to expreſſe the greateſt Paſſion and Affection in the Order of your Proceeding, and no leſſe errour and miſunderſtanding in your Judgements and Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>He doth remember well the Obligation of his Truſt, and of his Oath, and deſires that you will do ſo too, and your own ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation, and then you will not onely think it convenient, but neceſſary to give his Majeſty a full reparation for all the Scandals laid upon him, and all the ſcandalous Poſitions made againſt him; and that it is leſſe diſhonour to retract Errours, then by avowing to confeſſe the Malice of them, and will ſee this to be the ſureſt way for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the redemption of your Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the happineſſe and proſperity of your ſelves, and all our Dominions, and of the dignity and freedome of Parliament.</p>
